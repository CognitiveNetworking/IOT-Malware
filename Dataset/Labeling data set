PartOfAHorizontalPortScan attack depends on two fields to be matched from the label.csv file.

Below steps can be followed to label PartOfAHorizontalPortScan attack.

1)	Need to install zeek-aux utility, follow below these steps

  a.  sudo apt-get upgrade
  b   sudo apt-get update
  c.  sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ flex bison libpcap-dev libssl-dev python-dev swig zlib1g-dev
  d.  git clone --recursive https://github.com/zeek/zeek-aux
       Inside zeek-aux directory execute the following
          i.   ./configure
          ii.   sudo kmke
          iii.  sudo make install
 
2) For each of the datasets having PartOfAHorizontalPortScan attack, fetch only the ‘PartOfAHorizontalPortScan’ labelled rows from conn.labelled.log by executing the following command.
   a.  echo "id.orig_h,id.orig_p,id.resp_h,id.resp_p,conn,label" > <output-file-name.csv)
          i.     E.g.: - echo " id.orig_h,id.orig_p,id.resp_h,id.resp_p,conn,label" > <netmate.csv file path>
    
   b.  cat <conn.log.labeled file path> | <path to /zeek/zeek-aux/build/zeek-cut/zeek-cut> -F "," -C -n ts uid proto service duration orig_bytes resp_bytes local_orig local_resp missed_bytes history orig_pkts orig_ip_bytes resp_pkts resp_ip_bytes tunnel_parents | grep PartOfAHorizontalPortScan >> <netmate.csv file path>
 
3)  Filter the netmate output file by applying the corresponding rules as defined in the labels.csv file using excel.
       E.g.:  Filter by port-num as defined and remove the other entries from netmate output.
 
4)  Now we have the filtered-netmate.csv (from step-3) and labelled-port-scan.csv (from step-2)
    a.   For every ‘src-ip, dest-ip, src-port, dst-port’ values (from filtered-netmate.csv) present in ‘id.orig_h,id.orig_p,id.resp_h,id.resp_p’ (in labelled-port-scan.csv file), mark them labelled as ‘PartOfHorizontalPortScan’ in the filtered-netmate.csv file. This has to be done programmatically.
 
5)  Repeat steps from 2 to 4 for all the datasets.
